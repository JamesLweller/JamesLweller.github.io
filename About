            <h2>About</h2>
            <p class="lead mb-5">I recently completed my MSc in forensic psychology.
              I am keen to pursue a career in data science or a research related position.
              As part of my B.Sc. and M.Sc. I completed modules for research methods,
              advanced research methods, and data analysis. Mainly focusing on planning,
              data collection, cleansing, manipulate, visualisation, hypothesis
              testing and reporting. I am skilled in both quantitative (numerical
              and categorical data) and qualitative (face-to-face interviews).
              I have been using IBM SPSS for five years. I am self-taught in R
              programming language (R and Rstudio) having been using R for over
              2 years. I am also skilled in data analysis in Python having been
              using python for over year. I have a working knowledge of SQL.</p>

              <p class="lead mb-5"> I have excellent communication skills working
                for four years in a customer orientated role helping customers
                face-to-face and over the telephone. I am highly skilled in solving
                problems in diverse and stressful environments. This has allowed
                me to develop a confident, enthusiastic and approachable persona.
                I have an excellent ability to work within a team and to work on
                my own initiative. I also have excellent leadership skill running
                a weekly student-led session for first-year students and I am a
                member of the Institute of Leadership & Management. I was a committee
                member of a society at university, a role that involved organising
                and planning events. </p>
