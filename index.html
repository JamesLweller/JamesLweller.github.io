            <h2>About</h2>
            <p class="lead mb-5">I recently completed my MSc in forensic psychology.
              I am keen to pursue a career in data science or a research related position.
              As part of my B.Sc. and M.Sc. I completed modules for research methods,
              advanced research methods, and data analysis. Mainly focusing on planning,
              data collection, cleansing, manipulate, visualisation, hypothesis
              testing and reporting. I am skilled in both quantitative (numerical
              and categorical data) and qualitative (face-to-face interviews).
              I have been using IBM SPSS for five years. I am self-taught in R
              programming language (R and Rstudio) having been using R for over
              2 years. I am also skilled in data analysis in Python having been
              using python for over year. I have a working knowledge of SQL.</p>

              <p class="lead mb-5"> I have excellent communication skills working
                for four years in a customer orientated role helping customers
                face-to-face and over the telephone. I am highly skilled in solving
                problems in diverse and stressful environments. This has allowed
                me to develop a confident, enthusiastic and approachable persona.
                I have an excellent ability to work within a team and to work on
                my own initiative. I also have excellent leadership skill running
                a weekly student-led session for first-year students and I am a
                member of the Institute of Leadership & Management. I was a committee
                member of a society at university, a role that involved organising
                and planning events. </p>

          <h4>Big five</h4>
          <p class="lead mb-5"> The big five personality traits (Openness to
            experience, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, Neuroticism)
            are one of the most commonly used psychometric scales for studying
            personality. This project focuses on the differences between males
            and females, personality differences in relation to race and hand use. </p>

            three different products (Milk, Grocery, & Frozen) using Cluster
            Analysis. To see if customer can group based on their purchases.
            This kind of analysis would be useful in recommending new products
            to existing customers. </p>

          <h4>Cyberbullying</h4>
          <p class="lead mb-5"> With the increase of technology in the last decade
            Cyberbullying has become much more promatic. Data used in this project
            looks at Cyberbullying in university students to examine whether
            individuals that are victims of cyberbullying have higher levels of
            mental illness and alcohol use compared to a control group that have
            never been victims of cyberbullying. The second part of this study
            also looks at cyberbullying in a non-student population and whether
            this group react differently compare to a control group.</p>

            constructs comparing males and females. However, this project uses a
            one-way multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) to test whether
            there is a significant differences between males and females for each
            of the five constructs.</p>

          <h4>Shooting 2013 - 2017</h4>
          <p class="lead mb-5"> Mass-shooting in America are all to common with
            hundreds of people dying as a result of these tradities each year.
            This project looks looks at mass shootings in the United States
            between 2013 and 2017. The main purposes is to look for patterns in
            the data set for when these kind of events are more likely to take
            place. Which is useful for the police and security service to understand
            this kind of data to try and prevent this kind of events taking place
            in the future.</p>

          <h4>Shooting 1966 - 2017</h4>
          <p class="lead mb-5"> This is the second project that looks at mass
            shooting in america. However, this dataset is from 1966 - 2017 and
            does not include all event only ones that have larger mass casualties.
            Therefore this dataset leads to different conclusions. Compared to
            the 2013-2017 dataset. This kind of selective data can still be useful.
            As it would not be possible for the police to prevent all shooting
            in America but it might be possible to prevent higher casualties
            incidents from taking place by understanding the patterns and trends
            in the data. </p>

          <h4>Trait Emotional Intelligence</h4>
          <p class="lead mb-5"> Stress, mental illness and substance misuse is a
            significant issues among students at university. However, research
            suggests that individual with high levels of trait emotional intelligence
            may be able to cope better with these issues compared to individuals
            with low levels of trait emotional intelligence. This project looks
            at university students using standardised psychometrics.</p>

          <h4>Cyberbullying Dissertation</h4>
          <p class="lead mb-5"> Cyberbullying has become a significant issue for
            many students (Garett, Lord, & Young, 2016). Unfortunately, the vast
            majority of research has focused on adolescents and children
            (Privitera & Campbell, 2009). The aim of this study is to investigate
            the relationship between cybervictimisation, depression, anxiety,
            and alcohol use in university students. The participants were aged
            between 18 to 52 years (n=144, 62% female) completed four self-report
            questionnaires looking at cybervictimisation, depression, anxiety,
            and alcohol use. Fifty-one percent of students reported experiencing
            cybervictimisation. It was found that there was a significant relationship
            between depression and cybervictimisation scores. It was also found
            that there was a significant difference for anxiety and depression
            among students that reported cybervictimisation and non-victimised
            students. The finding suggests that cybervictimisation may have a
            negative effect on a student's psychological well-being but may be
            just one of many issues that negatively affect students mental health.</p>

          <h4>Cyberbullying Systematic Review</h4>
          <p class="lead mb-5"> This is a systematic review (k = 12) that focuses
            on cyberbullying, depression, anxiety and alcohol use. This review
            looked at cyberbullying in an adult population. It was found that
            there was a significant relationship between cyberbullying and mental
            health. However, no relationship was found between cyberbullying and
            alcohol use. This suggests that cyberbullying can have a significant
            effect on an individual's psychological well-being.</p>

          <h4>Trait Emotional Intelligence Dissertation</h4>
          <p class="lead mb-5"> Students at university are under a lot of pressure,
            some students cope well while others succumb to substance and/or mental
             health problems. One possible explanation why some cope better than
             others is Trait Emotional Intelligence (TEI). Students (N=178) were
             recruited to participate in the study, (Females N=125, Mage=23.47)
             each participant answered five questionnaires (Trait Emotional
             Intelligence Questionnaire–Short Form, Alcohol Use Disorders
             Identification test, Drug Use Disorders Identification Test, Patient
             Health Questionnaire-9 & Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7) administered
             via qualtrics. To assess student self-reported levels of substance
             use and mental health and their TEI. Data analysis shows that higher
             levels of TEI have a significant relationship with lower levels of
             drug use, anxiety and depression, however, no relationship was found
             for alcohol use. This research supports what other researchers have
             found, that TEI may be a protective factor against developing these
             problems (Davis & Humphreys, 2012). Universities could introduce
             programmes to students educating them before these issues become
             problematic.</p>
