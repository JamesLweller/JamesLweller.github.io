            <p>Mass-shooting in America are all too common with hundreds of people dying as a result of these tragedies each year. This project looks at mass shootings in the United States between 2013 and 2017. The main purposes are to look for patterns in the data for when these kind of events are more likely to take place. Which is useful for the police and security service to understand and try to prevent this kind of events from taking place in the future.</p>

            personality. This project focuses on the differences between males

            Cyberbullying has become much more problematic. Data used in this project
            looks at Cyberbullying in university students to examine whether
            individuals that are victims of cyberbullying have higher levels of
            mental illness and alcohol use compared to a control group that has
            never been victims of cyberbullying. The second part of this study
            also looks at cyberbullying in a non-student population and whether
            this group react differently compared to a control group.</p>

            Therefore this dataset leads to different conclusions. Compared to
            the 2013-2017 dataset. This kind of selective data can still be useful.
            As it would not be possible for the police to prevent all shooting
            in America but it might be possible to prevent higher casualties
            incidents from taking place by understanding the patterns and trends

          <h4>Cyberbullying Dissertation</h4>
          <p class="lead mb-5"> Cyberbullying has become a significant issue for
            many students (Garett, Lord, & Young, 2016). Unfortunately, the vast
            majority of research has focused on adolescents and children
            (Privitera & Campbell, 2009). The aim of this study is to investigate
            the relationship between cybervictimisation, depression, anxiety,
            and alcohol use in university students. The participants were aged
            between 18 to 52 years (n=144, 62% female) completed four self-report
            questionnaires looking at cybervictimisation, depression, anxiety,
            and alcohol use. Fifty-one percent of students reported experiencing
            cybervictimisation. It was found that there was a significant relationship
            between depression and cybervictimisation scores. It was also found
            that there was a significant difference for anxiety and depression
            among students that reported cybervictimisation and non-victimised
            students. The finding suggests that cybervictimisation may have a
            negative effect on a student's psychological well-being but may be
            just one of many issues that negatively affect students mental health.</p>

          <h4>Cyberbullying Systematic Review</h4>
          <p class="lead mb-5"> This is a systematic review (k = 12) that focuses
            on cyberbullying, depression, anxiety and alcohol use. This review
            looked at cyberbullying in an adult population. It was found that
            there was a significant relationship between cyberbullying and mental
            health. However, no relationship was found between cyberbullying and
            alcohol use. This suggests that cyberbullying can have a significant
            effect on an individual's psychological well-being.</p>

          <h4>Trait Emotional Intelligence Dissertation</h4>
          <p class="lead mb-5"> Students at university are under a lot of pressure,
            some students cope well while others succumb to substance and/or mental
             health problems. One possible explanation why some cope better than
             others is Trait Emotional Intelligence (TEI). Students (N=178) were
             recruited to participate in the study, (Females N=125, Mage=23.47)
             each participant answered five questionnaires (Trait Emotional
             Intelligence Questionnaire–Short Form, Alcohol Use Disorders
             Identification test, Drug Use Disorders Identification Test, Patient
             Health Questionnaire-9 & Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7) administered
             via qualtrics. To assess student self-reported levels of substance
             use and mental health and their TEI. Data analysis shows that higher
             levels of TEI have a significant relationship with lower levels of
             drug use, anxiety and depression, however, no relationship was found
             for alcohol use. This research supports what other researchers have
             found, that TEI may be a protective factor against developing these
             problems (Davis & Humphreys, 2012). Universities could introduce
             programmes to students educating them before these issues become
             problematic.</p>
