            <p>With the increase in technology in the last decade
              Cyberbullying has become much more problematic. Data used in this project
              looks at Cyberbullying in university students to examine whether
              individuals that are victims of cyberbullying have higher levels of
              mental illness and alcohol use compared to a control group that has
              never been victims of cyberbullying. The second part of this study
              also looks at cyberbullying in a non-student population and whether
              this group react differently compared to a control group.</p>

              This project looks at mass shootings in the United States between 2013
              and 2017. The main purposes are to look for patterns in the data for
              when these kind of events are more likely to take place. Which is
              useful for the police and security service to understand and try to
              prevent this kind of events from taking place in the future.</p>

              Therefore this dataset leads to different conclusions. Compared to
              the 2013-2017 dataset. This kind of selective data can still be useful.
              As it would not be possible for the police to prevent all shooting
              in America but it might be possible to prevent higher casualties
              incidents from taking place by understanding the patterns and trends

          <h4>Cyberbullying Dissertation</h4>
          <p class="lead mb-5"> Cyberbullying has become a significant issue for
            many students (Garett, Lord, & Young, 2016). Unfortunately, the vast
            majority of research has focused on adolescents and children
            (Privitera & Campbell, 2009). The aim of this study is to investigate
            the relationship between cybervictimisation, depression, anxiety,
            and alcohol use in university students. The participants were aged
            between 18 to 52 years (n=144, 62% female) completed four self-report
            questionnaires looking at cybervictimisation, depression, anxiety,
            and alcohol use. Fifty-one percent of students reported experiencing
            cybervictimisation. It was found that there was a significant relationship
            between depression and cybervictimisation scores. It was also found
            that there was a significant difference for anxiety and depression
            among students that reported cybervictimisation and non-victimised
            students. The finding suggests that cybervictimisation may have a
            negative effect on a student's psychological well-being but may be
            just one of many issues that negatively affect students mental health.</p>

          <h4>Cyberbullying Systematic Review</h4>
          <p class="lead mb-5"> This is a systematic review (k = 12) that focuses
            on cyberbullying, depression, anxiety and alcohol use. This review
            looked at cyberbullying in an adult population. It was found that
            there was a significant relationship between cyberbullying and mental
            health. However, no relationship was found between cyberbullying and
            alcohol use. This suggests that cyberbullying can have a significant
            effect on an individual's psychological well-being.</p>

          <h4>Trait Emotional Intelligence Dissertation</h4>
          <p class="lead mb-5"> Students at university are under a lot of pressure,
            some students cope well while others succumb to substance and/or mental
             health problems. One possible explanation why some cope better than
             others is Trait Emotional Intelligence (TEI). Students (N=178) were
             recruited to participate in the study, (Females N=125, Mage=23.47)
             each participant answered five questionnaires (Trait Emotional
             Intelligence Questionnaire–Short Form, Alcohol Use Disorders
             Identification test, Drug Use Disorders Identification Test, Patient
             Health Questionnaire-9 & Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7) administered
             via qualtrics. To assess student self-reported levels of substance
             use and mental health and their TEI. Data analysis shows that higher
             levels of TEI have a significant relationship with lower levels of
             drug use, anxiety and depression, however, no relationship was found
             for alcohol use. This research supports what other researchers have
             found, that TEI may be a protective factor against developing these
             problems (Davis & Humphreys, 2012). Universities could introduce
             programmes to students educating them before these issues become
             problematic.</p>

          <h4>Can an individual's Cognitive Thinking Style and Decision Making
            Ability Predict Performance on CRT?
          </h4>
          <p class="lead mb-5"> Dual processing Theory is an important part of
            rational decision making (Stanovich & West, 2000). This involves two
            systems; System one and System two that work together to solve simple
            and complex problems. This study looked at Actively Open-Minded
            Thinking Scale, Temporal Discounting and The Cognitive Failures
            Questionnaire and if they would predict scores on the Cognitive
            Reflection Test (CRT; Frederick, 2005). The participants are 167
            university students aged between 19-67. The results show that the
            model is significant. However, only one predictor significantly
            predicted scores on CRT. This provides added support to past research
             that has found similar findings. Future research could expand this
             study by re-evaluating these predictors and look at new predictors
             that show a relationship CRT and cognitive reasoning tools. .</p>
